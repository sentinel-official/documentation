Conventional VPNs are controlled by centralized organizations that own the servers and hardware through which your internet activities pass.

By opening up the code to public scrutiny, the risk of hacking is significantly reduced, as a community of skilled individuals can identify vulnerabilities and contribute to its improvement. Simultaneously, the transparent nature of the Sentinel software ensures that no logs are kept.
