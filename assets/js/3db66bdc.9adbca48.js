The reason for this is because normal VPNs are control by a centralized organization. They own the servers and other hardware you connect to. They know exactly who you are, where you are from and how you are using the internet since everything you do goes through their network. Can you be 100% sure they don\u2019t keep any logs?

By open sourcing the code it reduces the chances of being hacked by a lot because so many smart and intelligent people can see how it works, point out vulnerabilities and help improve it. At the same time everyone can see that no logs are being kept by the Sentinel software. And even if 1 node gets hacked on its own (not through the Sentinel software itself), the damage is contained within that 1 node not effecting everyone else.
